What is the punishment for it?\nHow the New Criminal Laws does cracks down on Organized crimes?", "llm_answer": "Here's how the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, addresses your questions:\n\n1.  **Crimes against the State (\"Deshdroh\"):**\n    The BNS has repealed IPC Section 124A (Sedition). Instead, BNS Section 152 deals with \"Acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.\" While the term \"sedition\" is removed, the new provision focuses on acts that excite or attempt to excite secession, or disaffection against India, or endanger the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India. The punishment can extend to life imprisonment or imprisonment for up to seven years, along with a fine.\n\n2.  **Punishment for First-Time Offender:**\n    The BNS introduces community service as a form of punishment for petty offences, which can be particularly relevant for first-time offenders. While there isn't a blanket rule for all crimes, judicial discretion generally considers the absence of prior convictions during sentencing.\n\n3.  **Mob-Lynching:**\n    Yes, the BNS explicitly defines and provides punishment for mob lynching. BNS Section 103, which deals with murder (corresponding to IPC Section 302), includes a specific provision for mob lynching. BNS Section 103(2) states that when a group of five or more persons acting in concert commits murder on grounds of race, caste, community, sex, place of birth, language, personal belief, or any other similar ground, each member of such group shall be punished with death or with imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n4.  **Organized Crimes:**\n    The BNS introduces a dedicated provision to crack down on organized crimes. BNS Section 111 specifically defines and provides for the punishment of \"Organized crime.\" It covers various activities like kidnapping, extortion, cyber-crimes, etc., carried out by a group of persons acting in concert. The punishment for organized crime can range from imprisonment for five years to life, and if such crime results in death, it can even lead to the death penalty or imprisonment for life.

The BNS introduces **Section 152**, titled \"Acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,\" which covers acts that excite or attempt to excite secession, or encourage feelings of armed rebellion or subversive activities, or endanger the sovereignty or unity and integrity of India. The punishment is imprisonment for life or up to seven years, and a fine.\n\n2.  **Punishment for First-Time Offender:**\n    The BNS introduces \"Community Service\" as a new form of punishment for petty offences, aiming for reformative justice. For other offences, the punishment remains as prescribed, but the focus is also on rehabilitation.\n\n3.  **Mob-Lynching:**\n    Yes, mob lynching has been specifically defined and criminalized under the BNS. **BNS Section 103(2)** states that when a group of five or more persons acting in concert commits murder on the basis of race, caste or community, sex, place of birth, language, personal belief, or any other similar ground, each member of such group shall be punished with death or with imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n4.  **Organized Crimes:**\n    The BNS introduces a specific provision for organized crime. **BNS Section 111** defines and provides stringent punishment for organized crime, including kidnapping, extortion, cyber-crimes, economic offences, and drug trafficking, when committed by a group of persons acting in concert. The punishment ranges from imprisonment for five years to life imprisonment, and even death in cases causing death.\n\n5.  **Community Service in the New Criminal Laws:**\n    Community Service is a new form of punishment introduced by the BNS for petty offences. It involves unpaid work for the benefit of the community, serving as an alternative to imprisonment, especially for first-time offenders, and aims at rehabilitation.\n\n6.  **Snatching:**\n    The BNS specifically defines and punishes snatching. **BNS Section 304** states that whoever commits snatching shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n7.  **Technology incorporated in BNSS:**\n    The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, which replaces the CrPC, heavily incorporates technology. Key features include:\n    *   Mandatory forensic investigation for offences punishable with seven years or more imprisonment.\n    *   Electronic FIRs (e-FIRs).\n    *   Summons, warrants, and examination of witnesses through electronic means.\n    *   Recording of statements and evidence through audio-visual electronic means.\n    *   Digitization of records and trials.\n\n8.  **Prevent Over-crowding in jails:**\n    The new laws aim to prevent overcrowding through:\n    *   Introduction of community service for petty offences.\n    *   Increased use of technology to expedite investigations and trials.\n    *   Provisions for summary trials for certain offences.\n    *   Emphasis on timely disposal of cases.\n\n9.  **Witness Safety:**\n    The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) includes provisions for witness protection. **BNSS Section 398** mandates State Governments to prepare and notify a Witness Protection Scheme. It also allows for recording of statements through audio-visual electronic means and measures to protect the identity of witnesses.\n\n10. **Acid attack victims has no justice under new criminal law:**\n    This is incorrect. The BNS provides stringent punishment for acid attacks. **BNS Section 113** (similar to IPC Sections 326A and 326B) prescribes punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, with imprisonment not less than ten years, which may extend to imprisonment for life, and a fine. It also mandates compensation to the victim.\n\n11. **Dacoity and cyber crimes have no place in the criminal laws under BNS:**\n    This is incorrect.\n    *   **Dacoity:** The BNS retains provisions for dacoity. **BNS Section 309** (similar to IPC Section 395) punishes dacoity with imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment up to ten years, and a fine.\n    *   **Cyber Crimes:** BNS Section 111 (Organized Crime) explicitly includes cyber-crimes within its ambit. Additionally, the Information Technology Act, 2000, continues to address specific cyber offences.\n\n12. **I have been cheated by my family members I cannot file case against them under BNS:**\n    This is incorrect. The BNS does not exempt family members from criminal liability for cheating. **BNS Section 318** (similar to IPC Section 420) deals with cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, and anyone, including a family member, can be prosecuted if they commit this offence.\n\n13. **My pet dog cannot be held and convicted for any offence:**\n    This is correct. Animals cannot be held criminally liable under any law. Criminal liability applies only to human beings.\n\n14. **I have got dog bite from my neighbours dog and police cannot register FIR:**\n    This is incorrect. While the dog cannot be prosecuted, an FIR can be registered against the owner of the dog for negligence. **BNS Section 289** (similar to IPC Section 289) punishes negligent conduct with respect to any animal, which can include not taking sufficient care to guard against any probable danger to human life or grievous hurt from such animal.\n\n15. **Bns does not punish for sedition:**\n    This is partially correct in terminology but incorrect in substance. The specific term \"sedition\" (IPC Section 124A) has been removed. However, the BNS introduces **Section 152** which punishes \"Acts endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,\" covering similar acts that were previously prosecuted under sedition, but with a broader and more defined scope.\n\n16. **The doctors cannot be punished for their rash act under the new criminal laws:**\n    This is incorrect. Doctors, like any other professional, can be held liable for criminal negligence. **BNS Section 106** (similar to IPC Section 304A) punishes causing death by any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide.\n\n17. **Motor Accident is no longer crime in india due to new criminal law and no provision contained in the bns to punish the offenders:**\n    This is incorrect. Motor accidents resulting in injury or death are still crimes. **BNS Section 106** deals with causing death by negligence, and **BNS Section 107** deals with causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others. The Motor Vehicles Act also has provisions for road safety offences.\n\n18. **The bns punishes the offender of motor accident laws for 20 years whereas under old ipc law it was only 2 years:**\n    This statement is partially correct regarding the increase in punishment but incorrect about the duration.\n    *   Under the old IPC Section 304A, causing death by negligence (including motor accidents) was punishable with imprisonment up to 2 years.\n    *   Under the BNS, **Section 106(1)** punishes causing death by negligence with imprisonment up to 5 years.\n    *   Crucially, **BNS Section 106(2)** introduces a more severe punishment for a specific scenario: if a person causes death by a rash and negligent act and *fails to report the incident to a police officer or Magistrate soon after the incident*, they shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine.\n    *   So, the punishment has significantly increased, especially for hit-and-run cases, from 2 years to up to 10 years, not 20 years.", "verifications": [{"claim": "The term \"Sedition\" (IPC Section 124A) has been removed from the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).", "status": "moderate_evidence", "confidence": 0.65, "evidence": "Significance: Stronger protection for children against trafficking and\nsexual exploitation.\nBNS Section 106 - Death by Negligence and Hit-and-Run\nIPC Section 304A: Causing death by rash or negligent act -\nimprisonment up to 2 years with fine.\nBNS Changes:\nSignificance: Addresses critical road safety concern.
